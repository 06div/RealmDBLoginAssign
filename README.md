App Description -
The Project contains all the required operations and details. First page contains Login activity. If you have an account then login with it. otherwise the second activity contains a signup page to make an account then sign in with it. These two activities have used Firebase. After sign in, then it redirects to a third activity which shows data (used Realm database for storage) in recyclerView. With the help of a spinner we can sort recycler view data on the bases of Name, Age and City.
Note: you can sign in with (user name = sanj@gmail.com, password = Sanj*1234) if you don't want to signup. with firebase use for signin and signup you have to give a proper email like the above one otherwise it'll give you an exception.
This project is based on all new updates.
